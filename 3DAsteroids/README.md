# 3D Asteroids
![]()

## Brief Game Description
This was a project that I made to learn the basics of Unreal Engine. It is my attempt at recreating the classic asteroids arcade game, in a 3D environment. After I made a basic version I realised that it was too easy, so for an extra challenge I added in the Earth that can also be hit by the falling asteroids, so the player has to protect the Earth from getting hit, while also avoid getting hit themselves.
