## _A brief game descriptions_

**Head On** is a 2D puzzle platformer game that centers around a robot that no longer has it's head attached and has to carry it in order to see. Traverse long abandoned factories while solving puzzles to reach another robot that still functions. 

## _My contributions to the project_

I worked alongside the other programmers on several of the game's systems, constantly iterating on eachothers code. The parts that I contributed most to was a checkpoint system, debug functions, pause menu, changing controls in settings, code cleaning and adding jucie to the game.
