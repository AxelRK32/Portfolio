## _A brief game description_

**Monkey paw** is a 3D first person story game that is about a monkey's downward spiral involving debt and gambling. Talk with the other monkeys during the day to try and scrape together some money. At night, head down to the local gambling den to try and win enough money to repay your debt. Over the course of a week, you get more and more desperate and resort to even more reprehensible acts. 

## _My contributions to the project_
I worked on this game alongside three other programmers. We each got some functions and areas to focus on, but would on occasion iterate on each others code to ensure that all the systems worked together. I was assigned to work on a save system, inventory and shop systems, a pause menu, a day/night transition, implementing animations and sound effects, along with some more general juice in different parts of the game.
